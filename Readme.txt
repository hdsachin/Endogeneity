#This file explains, how to find an endogeniety in the econometric models.#Hausman algorithm to find the endogenous variable. 
#However if the endogenous variables are more than one. From the procedure written down here, simultaniety problem 
#which is one of the causes for endogeniety can be detected. Potentially reducing the number of endogenous variables
