#This file explains, how to find an endogeniety in the econometric models. #Hausman algorithm is used to find the endogenous variable. 
#However if the endogenous variables are more than one. Simultaniety problem 
#which is one of the causes for endogeniety can be verified. Potentially reducing the number of endogenous variables
