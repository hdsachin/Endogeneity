Two level endogeneity test using Hausman algorithm: 

#Aim: To perform multi-level test of simultaneity condition to be an endogenous variable.
This methodology helps to test the different levels of simultaneity problem (or interdependency) of the explanatory variables.

#Procedure: 

I. In step1 of algorithm, test on omitted variables error, measurement error and simultaneity error 
on each explanatory variables is performed. This tests gives the list of endogenous variables. 

II. In step2, if more than one endogenous variables are detected, then check for simutaneity condition between 
the endegenous variables detected in  step1. 



#Econometric equation: 

Dependent variable = a*x1 + b*x2 + c*x3 + d*x4 + u   

x1, x2, x3 and x4 are the explanatory variables and a, b, c and d are their respective co-efficients. 
u is the residual term.



#Algorithm

Step1: 

I. Check with endogeneity of each dependent variable one by one using the R command given in he following, 

#R command to check endogeniety of x1

sys_ols_X1=systemfit(((dependent variable ~ x1, data = data, method = "OLS")

sys_iv_X1=systemfit(((dependentvariable ~ x1, data = data, method = "2SLS",inst = ~ x2+x3+x4)

hausman.systemfit(sys_iv_X1, sys_ols_X2)


II. If  more than one endogenous variable results from Step1 then go to Step2. For example x2, x3 and x4 are found out 
    to be endogenous variables. If only one endogenous varible is detected then, leave out that endogenous exploratory
    variable for the further econometric analysis. 


Step2:

I. Check for the simultaniety error between x2, x3 and x4. 

II. Check again the endogenous condition of x2 and x4 by not having x3 as the instrument variable.

sys_ols_X2=systemfit(((dependent variable ~ x2, data = data, method = "OLS")

sys_iv_X2=systemfit(((dependent variable ~ x2, data = data, method = "2SLS",inst = ~ x1+x4)

hausman.systemfit(sys_iv_X2, sys_ols_X2)


sys_ols_X4=systemfit(((dependent variable ~ x4, data = data, method = "OLS")

sys_iv_X4=systemfit(((dependent variable ~ x4, data = data, method = "2SLS",inst = ~ x1+x2)

hausman.systemfit(sys_iv_X4, sys_ols_X4)

III. Note down the result of Hausman test wheather the x2 and x4 are endogenous or exogenous in absence of x3.

III. Similarly verify the simultaneity error in other two endogenous (from step1) variables by not using the 
     third endogenous (from step1) variable as the instrument variable and note down the result of hausman test. 

IV. If the absence of any explanatory endogenous (from step1) variable make the ALL OTHER endogenous variables (from step1) 
    as exogenous in step2 result, then the absence of that variable is continued for further analysis. This
    is because in the absence of that variable remaining dependent variables are exogenous which were showed 
    endogeneity in the step1. Addionally the variable which are exogenous in step2 are considerd for further analysis. 
 

V. If the absence of an any explanatory endogenous (from step1) variable doesnot make the all other variable exogenous, 
   then it proves the absence of simultaneity problem between the explanatory endogenous variables from Step1.  


Step3: 

I. Check the simultaneity error of explanatory variable detected as endogenous on all other endogenous variable from
   step 1 by removing all other explanatory endogenous variables as instrument variables. This is the third level of test 
   to check simultaneity error. This step is used to check the simultaneity problem between an one endogenous variable 
   (from step1) on the other endogenous variables (from step1) together. Example provided below

   Endogenous test for x2 without x3 and x4 as instrument variable


sys_ols_X2=systemfit(((dependent variable ~ x2, data = data, method = "OLS")

sys_iv_X2=systemfit(((dependent variable ~ x2, data = data, method = "2SLS",inst = ~ w)

hausman.systemfit(sys_iv_X2, sys_ols_X2)

# Inference: 

I. From the above result, when x2 which was detected for endogeneity in step1 is removed from the 
analysis then x3 and x4 which were detected as endogenous variable in step1 are resulted as exogenous variables after 
step2 and step3 subsequently. 

II. This methodology helps to test the different levels of simulteneity problem (or interdependency) of the 
explanatory variables.
